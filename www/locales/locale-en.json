After that, these cells transmit information to the brain through the optic nerve in a region of the cerebral cortex especially dedicated to color recognition.<br \/> The vision deficiencies are called dyschromatopsias.<\/p>\n<p>They are hereditary, such as color blindness, or acquired such as following an eye disease.<\/p>","DALTONISM_TITLE":"Color blindness - inherited dyschromatopsias","DALTONISM_CONTENT":"<p>The frequency of color blindness is, on average, 8% among men and 0.5% among women.<br \/> This disparity is due to the fact that color blindness of the gene is carried by the X sex chromosome and is recessive. What this means is simply that the presence of a normal gene for the abnormality is not expressed.<\/p>\n<p>A woman with two X chromosomes, will be color blind only if both chromosomes inherited from both parents carry the defective gene which is indeed a rare event.<\/p>\n<p>However, a man with only one X chromosome, inherited from his mother, will be color blind if that X chromosome has the abnormal gene on it.<\/p>\n<p>In Daltonism, all 3 cones are lacking.<\/p>","DICROMATE_TITLE":"Dichromate","DICROMATE_CONTENT":"<p>One of the cones is absent, and vision will involve only the two remaining colors instead of the three normally used.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>protanopic <\/strong> : sees only green and blue, red is missing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>deuteranope <\/strong> : (most common) sees only the red and the blue, green is absent.<\/li>\n<li><strong>tritanope<\/strong> : sees only the red and green, blue is missing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","TRICHROMATE_TITLE":"Trichromat","TRICHROMATE_CONTENT":"<p>Trichomate abnormal: the three channels are present but is deficient.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>protanomal<\/strong> : red is deficient<\/li>\n<li><strong>deuteranomal <\/strong> : green is deficient<\/li>\n<li><strong>tritanomal<\/strong> : blue is deficient<\/li>\n<\/ul>","ACHROMATE_TITLE":"Achromatic","ACHROMATE_CONTENT":"<p>This is the total absence of color perception. Patients with this condition see the world in black and white and shades of gray because the cones are devoid of the usual 3 pigments that can see color.<\/p>\n<p>The visual cells do not regenerate and these vision problems are permanent and incurable.<\/p>","ACQUIRED_TITLE":"Acquired dyschromatopsias","ACQUIRED_CONTENT":"<p>This corresponds to a consecutive disturbance of ocular disease.
